Statistics visualisations
=========================

This is a (work-in-progress) Javascript port of the Java applet
[Vertrauensbereich f√ºr den Mittelwert](http://www.elektronik.htw-aalen.de/statistik-erleben/indexi.php?top=top.txt&nav=nav_applets.htm&main=Vertrauensbereich.html),
which visualises the estimation of the mean from a sample of values of a normally distributed random variable.

In future it should calculate the confidence interval of the estimated mean, but it doesn't do that yet.


Demo

This application should work in all modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc), but it is
*not compatible* with Internet Explorer 6, 7 and 8. Internet Explorer 9 and above should be ok.


Development
-----------

This project uses [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [jQuery](http://jquery.com/). In order to work on it,
you'll need to understand D3, which has a steep learning curve, but is very well-designed and
well-documented. It's worth your time to learn how to use it.
